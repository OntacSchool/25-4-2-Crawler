Placeholder Image Instructions

This application requires a placeholder image for the crawler visualization. To set it up:

1. Create a simple transparent or gray PNG image sized 600x400 pixels named "placeholder.png"
2. Save it in this directory (assets/placeholder.png)
3. The placeholder will be shown when no screenshots are available

Alternately, you can use a public domain or CC0 licensed image from a site like Unsplash or Pexels.

If the placeholder image is missing, the application will still function but the screenshot viewer will show a broken image.
