# Web Crawler System - Solution Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Canvas Module Error**: The system was failing due to missing the `canvas` npm package and its system dependencies.

2. **Socket.io Missing**: The system needed socket.io for real-time updates.

3. **Browser Visualization**: Added VNC server configuration to allow viewing the browser in action.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Code Changes for Resilience

- **OCR Service (src/ocr/ocrService.js)**:
  - Added graceful fallback for when canvas is not available
  - Created mock implementations to allow the system to run without canvas
  - Modified the error handling to prevent system crashes

- **Crawler Service (src/crawler/crawlerService.js)**:
  - Made OCR processing optional with the `skipOcr` flag
  - Added multi-level error handling to ensure crawl continues even if OCR fails
  - Enhanced screenshot handling to work with or without OCR

- **Crawler Controller**:
  - Improved error handling in the progress monitoring function

### 2. Docker Configuration

- **Dockerfile**:
  - Added canvas dependencies: `build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev`
  - Added VNC server components: `x11vnc xvfb fluxbox`
  - Created VNC password configuration
  - Added X11 display configuration
  - Modified startup command to run both VNC server and the application

- **docker-compose.yml**:
  - Exposed VNC port 5900
  - Added shared memory configuration for better browser performance
  - Added assets volume mapping
  - Added DISPLAY environment variable

### 3. Package Dependencies

- **package.json**:
  - Added canvas: `"canvas": "^2.11.2"`
  - Ensured socket.io is properly included

## How to Use the Updated System

1. **Rebuild Docker Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

3. **View the Browser in Action**:
   - Connect to localhost:5900 with any VNC viewer
   - Password: crawlerpassword

4. **Start a Crawl**:
   - From the web UI, select a target URL and start a crawl
   - For testing, use one of the following:
     - CNN: https://www.cnn.com
     - NYTimes: https://www.nytimes.com
     - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/linkedin-marketing-solutions/
     - Google Ad Library: https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/library

5. **Monitor the Crawl**:
   - Watch real-time progress in the web UI
   - View the actual browser through VNC

## Fallback Options

If you continue to experience issues with canvas:

1. **Skip OCR Processing**:
   - In the API call to start a crawl, add the option: `"skipOcr": true`
   - This will allow the crawler to run without OCR, still capturing screenshots

2. **Manual Installation**:
   - Connect to the running container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it web-crawler-system bash
   ```
   - Install dependencies manually:
   ```bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev
   cd /app
   npm install canvas
   ```

## Verification Steps

To verify the system is working correctly:

1. Check that the server starts without canvas errors
2. Confirm you can connect to the VNC server
3. Start a crawl with OCR skipped to test basic functionality
4. If canvas is properly installed, try a crawl with OCR enabled
